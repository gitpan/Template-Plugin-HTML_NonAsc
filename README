Template-Plugin-HTML_NonAsc

Template::Plugin::HTML_NonAsc is a filter fot the Template Toolkit.

It resembles the builtin 'html' filter but it only processes non-ASCII
characters. In particular, it leaves characters like < > & and " alone.

Its purpose is to make it possible to write HTML templates using
non-ASCII characters, and still produce HTML with &entities; to avoid
portability problems.
